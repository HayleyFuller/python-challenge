# Python challenge

## Instructions

Create folders for each of the challenges - named 'PyBank' and 'PyPoll'

**In each of the folders create the following:**

1) A folder named 'resources' - to contain the CSV files used.

2) A folder named 'analysis' - that contains the results from the analysis.

3) A file named 'main.py'

## Pybank challenge instructions:

4) The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

5) The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The final script should print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
